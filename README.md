The scalability of the code is maintained by the following:

--> The file has not been read as a whole. Reading a whold file might be slightly faster but if a file is too large than a system memory, then it will start using swap space and will be much slower, system may freeze and program will not process further or it may crash.

--> The indexes of the array for computations are not given hard-coded. They are dynamic even if the number of columns of csv file increases, the program will run just fine on the condition that column names of the existing does not change.
